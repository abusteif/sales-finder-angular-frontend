                    <p>Meet the team behind this obsession with savings! I'm a software engineer with an unhealthy addiction to Ozbargain and an irrational fear of paying full price for anything. My motto? "If it's not on sale, it's not worth buying." This pathological need to find the best deals everywhere led me to build a platform that does the bargain hunting for you.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>This whole operation started with my sister, an eBay entrepreneur who discovered that some retailers occasionally lose their minds and offer insane discounts. She came to me with a brilliant suggestion: "You know how you're always complaining about missing sales? Why don't you build something that finds them for you?"</p>
                    <p>And just like that, what began as a simple tool to track a few stores evolved into a focused deal-hunting platform that monitors sales across key retailers. Because why settle for missing out on bargains when you can stay on top of the stores that matter most?</p>

                        <li><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <strong>Plain text search</strong> - Search for anything using natural language, not just specific items</li>
